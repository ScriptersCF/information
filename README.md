### What is ScriptersCF?
ScriptersCF is a community for scripters and programmers, most of which are from the Roblox platform. We are most known for our Discord server, which has over 7,000 members as of 11th June 2020 and is home to the largest unofficial game jams and is amongst the most active Roblox development Discord servers.

In the future, we plan to expand by uploading high-quality content onto our YouTube channel, such as tutorials, development streams and more.

This organisation is home to open-source repositories that are maintained by members of our community. Any repositories can be submitted, provided they are deemed significant enough.
